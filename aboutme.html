<h2>projects i've worked on</h2>
    <p><b>Omabicon</b></p>
    <p>You know the Obama Hope poster?? We wrote a code to take any image and apply that same filter to it -- to "Obamify" the image.
      We basically used a for loop so that the computer looked through all of the pixels in a given image. Depending on the intensity
      of a pixel, the computer would assign the pixel one of four new RGB values. Intensity was a variable that we defined as all the
      RGB values of the pixel added together. The four different colors that were assigned were Dark Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, and Red,
      and we used an If/Then statement to assign different colors based on the intensity. </p>
    
    <p><b>Draw Shapes</b></p>
    <p>We used Python to access the Turtle Library to write a code that drew shapes. We used functions like forward, left, and right to
      control the movement of the "turtle" by giving it a certain value of degrees to turn. We could also control the pen color by 
      referencing specfic colors that the library was familiar with. We experimented with for loops to make triangles, squares, pentagons,
      etc. by inputting the formula for the number of degrees in a certain figure with n sides so that we could make shapes with
      continuously increasing number of sides.
      
    <p><b>Robots</b></p>
    <p>This was my favorite project! The robot was pre-assembled, but we were able to experiment a lot with making circuits on the 
      breadboard including LEDs, servo motors, piezo tone buzzers, and whisker wires that acted as tactile sensors. By writing a code
      in Arduino, we were able to make our robot sing and dance, as well as make a triggered response for when it ran into an object
      like a wall. We could make the robot emit certain tones by connecting the piezo and establishing a list of "notes" that were 
      defined by specific frequencies. The list of notes was placed in a for loop so that the robot would loop through all of the notes
      in the loop to play a song. The for loop was also used to repeat the robot's movements through functions like servoLeft.writeMicroseconds
      that would control the movement of the left servo. </p>
