    <p><b>Omabicon</b></p>
    <p>You know the Obama Hope poster?? We wrote a code to take any image and apply that same filter to it -- to "Obamify" the image.
      We basically used a for loop so that the computer looked through all of the pixels in a given image. Depending on the intensity
      of a pixel, the computer would assign the pixel one of four new RGB values. Intensity was a variable that we defined as all the
      RGB values of the pixel added together. The four different colors that were assigned were Dark Blue, Light Blue, Yellow, and Red,
      and we used an If/Then statement to assign different colors based on the intensity.
